# Recipes For Masters
A cooking/recipe website called ‘Recipes For Masters’ using HTML/CSS/JS.

This is a side project, initially for regular website building practice, created from scratch. Specifically, the application is a website that allows searching for recipes. The website is also designed to work for smaller screens/devices. 

One thing to note is that the API searching code/aspect was created by Harrison Kong that I have used from his coursera 'RESTful API with HTTP and JavaScript' course. However, connecting this to the rest of the application as well as the rest of the website was create by me.

Code by Harrison Kong:
- The full kitchenblue.js file
- Some styling used in style.css for recipes.html

The main features, all available through the navigation bar, currently are:
- Home page – an image tiled layout with no functionality
- Recipes page – allows searching for ingredients or dish name via input, this is powered by the Recipe Puppy API
- About page – placeholder text example for about us information
- Contact us page – placeholder text example for contact information

Developed on Visual Studio Code and ran/tested via Live Server.
